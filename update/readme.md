## Receiving updates for OOoLilyPond

| ANNOUNCEMENT | 
| :---: |
| OOoLilyPond has moved to a new repository: |
| **https://github.com/OOoLilyPond** |
| All past/present/future development can be found at the new location. The page you are viewing right here contains all development up to V. 1.0.1, but it will no longer be maintained. |

OOoLilyPond 0.5.0 (and later versions) will specify *ooolilypond-update.xml* in this directory as information source about newer versions.

ooolilypond-update.xml contains a download URL to the most recent *.oxt file. 

This will enable the extension manager of LibreOffice / OpenOffice to inform the user about new versions and perform the update process on request.
